You can Refocus by spending 10 minutes alone and in silence, darkness preferred. While flying in dim light or complete darkness, you can teleport up to 15 feet ahead in a straight line to another square also poorly lit. You must be able to see where you will emerge. Unlike most actions, this can be used in the middle of a Stride, allowing you to resume flying after teleporting. At expert Acrobatics, you can move up to 20 feet. At master, 30 feet. At legendary, 50 feet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>"
